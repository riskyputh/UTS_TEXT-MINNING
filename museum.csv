Old City Art Space,Barbara Fava,5.0,I‚Äôm constantly looking for something new to post on my instagram and this kind of museums caught my eyes since last time I was here in Indonesia but couldn‚Äôt visit for time schedule. I went today with my husband and a couple of friends and we had so much fun and took tons of crazy photos I‚Äôll show you here. The staff is super friendly and helps you taking the photos! Definitely a good museum to visit and learn more about 3D photography!
Old City Art Space,Ulfah Hidayatullah,3.0,"When I visited this area, 3D museum was still under renovation. So I just watched and took pictures from outside the building. Ummhh... a little weird with this big picture at the entrance. Why don't they think the chosen picture is a hero or anyone who plays a role in the establishment of Semarang City? This is actually a picture of a dog soldier ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
Old City Art Space,Mia Fitriyanti,4.0,"this place has great backgrounds with various 3D effects. Taking picture in each backrounds brings you to an unusual experience. Located in the old town of Semarang, this place also has great views around it"
Old City Art Space,Heru Kasidi,5.0,Very interesting place of old city if Semarang. Worth to visit for observing the beautiful old building and hang out with friends.
Old City Art Space,Avissa Suseno,4.0,"Good place that was made in regards to make 3D effect photos result. You need to pay for 50,000 IDR/person."
Old City Art Space,Jane Bing,5.0,A very unique place to go if you have time in semarang. Only for 20k ( they receive gopay/ovo too) The staff id very nice and helpful. He master the skill of photography and took a great photo too! The place is quite small but its a great experience
Old City Art Space,Anisa Kumala,5.0,Semarang's old city which has now turned out to be good and there are lots of visitors who come around it just for photo photos on the edge of the building around the old city of Semarang there are also many tourists who come but the place is very hot maybe because of lack of trees
Old City Art Space,Handry Carlos,3.0,"Ive been to other trick eye museum, this one feel like they lack of people for taking photoshoot of you, what does this museum mean when u came alone and no one to take your photo?"
Old City Art Space,Haifa Amalia Khoirunisah,3.0,I give 3 stars because the price is not appropriate for someone who expect a great adventure in taking 3D pictures. The picture of 3D looks old. And the lighting is not so good to take picture. But the service is good. You can ask help for taking picture to the employee there. Good
Old City Art Space,Radka Hola,5.0,It was fun..the staff was really helpful and friendly.. It takes only 20mins..but not expensive
Old City Art Space,virgan rakhmat yusuf,5.0,"Great and unique place to visit, especially for Instagram content hunter. Really crowded in holiday and weekend.Visited on Public holiday Wait time No wait Reservation recommended No ‚Ä¶More"
Old City Art Space,Hape Kece,4.0,"Unique, don't forget to visit here. This museum is very cool with awesome and interested properties and galleries that will make you feel Wow. Nah untuk yang bingung, lokasinya dekat Gereja Blenduk / Taman Srigunting. Biaya masuk Rp. 40.000"

Old City Art Space,Fransiscus Prawirasmoro,4.0,"Small but ok. Don't, forget to bring decent camera or smartphone camera to take pictures"
Old City Art Space,Danang Heru Wibowo,5.0,Once of 3D trick art museum in semarang that you need to see and find your happiness in there.. Feels like we already go to the place that created by..
Old City Art Space,Dini Astari,5.0,"The place is unique and interesting. The entrance fee is quite cheap (around IDR 50k). You can use a certain app to get a cheaper price if you buy it at least one day earlier. The staff was really nice and kind. He explained on how to get a really nice pictures. If you are travelling solo and the place isn't crowded yet, the staff can help you take pictures. They also sell lots of souvenirs, like t-shirts, fridge magnets, keyrings, etc."
Old City Art Space,Henny Lim,4.0,"Right on the corner where taxis usually stop by, the building looks vintage-but-clean from the outside. Entrance ticket is IDR 50k. Inside you can find a lot of tricky images, where you must adjust camera positioning to have fun photographs. The fun works better if you visit the museum in a group, for at least 2-3 persons, so your friends can help you taking the picture. If you're alone or just a group of 2, staffs are available to help you, but in peak days (esp Saturdays) they are a bit busy and there might be a long queue of visitors asking them to take pictures."
Old City Art Space,Ario Wirawan,5.0,"Awesome place to be in. ""Museum"" is just a name, because it definitely is not. It's essentially a photo booth, except it's huge and has plenty of 3D effect backgrounds to choose from where the results of the photos would seem like you were one with or/and inside the background. Perfect for family and group friends time."
Old City Art Space,Charylia Knightmare,5.0,"Best place to wasting your time with or without your family. So many good background with small detail are ready to make your picture looking so great. They provide some unique costume. The super friendly staff will help you to take some picture of you. For solo traveler, it's the good news. Because the staff will follow you all around the Museum to capture your picture. There is no photo spot in every background. So, you need to see the picture that hanged beside the background to see how the background work on you. The Museum sell some souvenirs with reasonable price. Such as t-shirt. It's 170k/ shirt."
Old City Art Space,Ameylinda Monica W,5.0,the ticket is a little bit pricey for me as a student but it's all worth when I step inside and exploring every 3D and trickart spot in it. very clean and nice staff everywhere to help you taking photos. just bring your valid school/university identity card to get 50% ticket discount.
Old City Art Space,Dadang NH,4.0,"Creative! Photoshoot place with unique designs. There are staff who will help you take photos. And they sell souvenirs. Unfortunately their parking space is so small. don't come by at weekend, there is so much people and it can distract your photo session."
Old City Art Space,Pradnyan Ibad,5.0,You may find a lot of eye tricking picts here lol
Old City Art Space,Yozar Firdaus Amrullah,5.0,"A nice place to take pictures, selfie, wefie. There are various interesting backgrounds that you can choose.

Old City Art Space,adangnof,3.0,Place for taking fun photos with 3d painting background
Old City Art Space,Ribka Simatupang,3.0,"Actually it's a place to take photos with many different backgrounds, angles and poses as you want. Once you enter the building, you will see various background photos in each room. You can also photo using wardrobe and it's free. Some of the background are quite hilarious such as khong guan biscuit design, nataional geographic magazine design, and selfie with the poster of Indonesian president, Mr Jokowi. In each room there are some staff who can help you take the photos. They can also help to shoot with the right angle. With the high level of narcism in Indonesia, the place is really popular because people want to take good selfie or photograph. But if you're not fan of selfie going to this place seems not worth the money. This place located in the middle of Semarang old city so it is very accessible."
Old City Art Space,Hendra Atmadja,5.0,"Great places with lots of 3D wallpaper to create interesting pics, staffs are pleasant and helpful, they even helped us by suggesting good choreograph for our pics, entrance fee is fair and affordable, this is a place you must visit in Semarang."

Old City Art Space,Tenun eBoon,3.0,"It is not a 3D painting. It was a picture. I am not expecting to see a picture or photo that arrange as a backgrounds and called it 3D, even more some of it they use real fixture rather than pictures or even painting i.e: they use real sakura flowers, real horse statue, real flowers in the garden."

Ronggowarsito Museum,Diantoro Deka Saputra,5.0,"Actually it‚Äôs a great museum. The collection of the museum was great, from pre historic until recent history, from archaeological, stones, until history of Javanese culture. But, there‚Äôs no clear concept how the visitor enjoy and learn from the museum. It will be better if the museum have some clear concept and have one way to enter until exit and have the full history experiences. Cheap ticket entrance."
Ronggowarsito Museum,Nat Furgeva,5.0,"This museum surprisingly displayed unexpected features you know. And funnily many Semarang inhabitants don't know about what is inside. You'll find a socio-geological history packed in neat wooden furniture. I ensure you to find a new wonderful experience while hanging around there, because this historical place isn't like another cliche and boring museum. Also, luckily there is an AC so you won't be dehydrated okay. But unfortunately, the second floor wasn't covered with AC. Then, that's fine to look around the first floor only if you can't handle the heat. The other surprising aspect was a 3D show. Telling us about the dinosaur ever existed. Btw, I've just to know that mammoth was existing in the last on Java's land. This museum is truly educating!"
Ronggowarsito Museum,MsErynn8,3.0,"Warning:Honest review..Hopefully the one involve will read this review for improvement..For your info there is Museum Fair ongoing at the moment started on 15 till the 19th of Sepetember.Unfortunately other than a big banner at the Museum itself..No announcement / widely publised on national newspaper or social media!.So there is less crowd to begin with.Doesnt help that the Museum really need a makeover(painting,replicas need to be updated and cleaned).It starts at 11 and closes at 3pm ?!An absurd hours..We went to this Museum and staffs are far from making us feel Welcoming,You get the impression that either they are uninterested to customers/public or simply were forced' to be at funfair or something...Otherwise nothing much to see as most stations are either closed/for renovation?!-then why the Museum Fair then?Sad to see good and precious artifacts are notvery well kept w for public view.Thank you.Hv a good day!Much to improve.!"
Ronggowarsito Museum,Wahyu Priyansah,5.0,"Awesome venue, heritage tourism place of Semarang. strategic, in the center of city, in main road, clean, huge parking area, has a hotel that good enough for the guess come from another city or country. good security.. and also really great venue to make wedding event.. #carakaeo #partnersetiapaacara"
Ronggowarsito Museum,Abida ‚ÄúAnna‚Äù Muttaqiena,5.0,"Great museum with huge collection. Here, you could learn geology, history, and culture of Java from various artifacts, fossils, dioramas, and many other historical displays. Tickets are cheap, and there's locker in the lobby. Also, there's large parking area which may benefit tour groups and families with car or bus. However, when I came (it was on Saturday), there's no tour guide while some displays are not accompanied with any plaque or description sheet, so it was not a very satisfactory visit."

Museum Kota Lama,Devi Ayuningtyas,5.0,"(Translated by Google) Because I like historical walking tours in the Old City, Semarang, I also really like seeing museums. Fortunately, there is now the Kota Lama Museum, so we can know more deeply that we can explore the relics in Kota Lama more deeply. There are so many relics that we can see in this museum. The explanations from the guides are detailed and easy to understand, so it's a fun time to learn history. In addition to what the guide has explained, we can also ask our guide about other things about the Old City and the museum. The best. When we entered, the health protocol was still running and we were loaned a tote bag for the footwear container when we toured inside, because later the footwear had to be removed. We can park our vehicle next to Indomaret, then walk to the museum. It is highly recommended to be careful when crossing, because the museum is located in the middle of the road.

Now what is not right for me is that when waiting for a session, there is no shady place. There are chairs, but it's hot when you sit there. For the inside of the museum, in my opinion, the collection is small, but quite informative. If you feel it is not informative, you can still ask the tour guide. Overall, it's worth the visit, let alone it's free. (Original) Akhirnya kesampaian juga buat ke museum yang masih tergolong baru ini. Untuk masuknya perlu reservasi melalui aplikasi Lunpia. Menurut saya masuk akal ya kalau harus reservasi dulu, soalnya bakal ditemani tour guide dan dibagi menjadi beberapa sesi. Dan ini FREE, tidak dipungut biaya sama sekali. Nah yang kurang pas bagi saya adalah ketika menunggu sesi, tidak ada tempat yang teduh. Ada sih kursi, tapi panas2an kalau duduk disitu. Untuk bagian dalam museumnya menurut saya sih hmm koleksinya memang sedikit tapi cukup informatif. Kalau dirasa kurang informatif pun masih bisa tanya ke tour guide nya.

Lawang Sewu often switched functions since it woke up in the Dutch colonial era as the colonial office of the Japanese later on as a prison house and early in the freedom of Indonesia became a railway station. The place is clean and you can visit from morning to night so it's quite appropriate if you want to feel night at the museum atmosphere. Affordable ticket prices for children and adults. If you use a car or motocycle you should be parked on the street and office complex beside Lawang sewu."

Lawang Sewu,Harry Potter,5.0,"who doesn't know Denham, the most iconic historical building in the city of Semarang. yak, the name Lawang Sewu. Lawang Sewu is a historical building from the Dutch colonial heritage that used to function as the center of offices at that time in short. This building has stood firmly in history since hundreds of years ago but its integrity is still maintained, which made it famous from Lawang / Pintu Sewu / Seribu to being a thousand doors.

It has many rooms but most of them are just empty rooms with historical posters about Indonesian train stations, trains, and Semarang itself. There's one spot that you should definitely take a photo of yourself there, it has pretty colorful mosaic windows, you will feel like you're in a European style church.

The other prison were 16 standing room size jailed 1 x 1 meter for 5-8 prisoners. And railway to the exit had executions room.

Lawang Sewu,Ivan Febriand Muhammad,5.0,"Lawang Sewu is a historic building in Indonesia located in Semarang City, Central Java. This building, which used to be the office of the Nederlands-Indische Spoorweg Maatschappij or NIS. It was built in 1904 and completed in 1907. It is located at the Tugu Muda circle which was formerly called Wilhelminaplein. Local people call it Lawang Sewu because the building has so many doors, despite the fact that the number of doors does not reach one thousand. This building has many windows that are tall and wide, so people often think of it as a gate. This old building is the location of a great battle between the AMKA youth or the Train Youth Force against Kempetai and Kidobutai, Japan. Therefore the Semarang City Government includes Lawang Sewu as one of 102 ancient or historic buildings in the city of Semarang that are worth protecting. Currently the old building has undergone a stage of conservation and revitalization carried out by the Unit Preservation of objects and historic buildings of PT Kereta Api Company. During the Japanese occupation in 1942, the basement of the Lawang Sewu building was formerly a drainage channel but was converted into an underground prison as well as a drainage channel. This building is also a silent witness to the fierce battle between the people of Indonesia and the Japanese army, known as the Battle of Five Days in Semarang. This underground jailis is a witness to the torture and massacre of Indonesian people, which was carried out by the Japanese army at the time of forced labor or romusha. The atmosphere in this place makes the hair stand on end, especially when entering a corner of a narrow room shaped like small pools that were used as prisoners."
